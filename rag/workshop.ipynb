    "\n",
    "\n",

    "  * More precise retrieval\n",
    "  * Better for finding specific details\n",

    "The query enhanced RAG pipeline is already a little agentic in the sense that it uses the `QueryEnhancer` to generate search queries and then uses the `retriever` to retrieve the most relevant documents. The query enhancer uses a LLM to generate the search queries and intents predictions. We then manually route these to the retriever and response generator. It also made use of Structured Outputs to return the results in a structured format. - This was an example of an llm using tool calling. \n",

    "\n",
    "We'll look at how we can implement an agentic RAG system using a tool use approach. The agent can search for information about how to use the product, retrieve information from the internet, and search code examples\n",

    "Concretely, we'll cover the following use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "`search_developer_docs`: Searches the Weights & Biases developer documentation\n",
    "`search_internet`: Searches the internet for general queries\n",
    "`search_code_examples`: Searches code examples and tutorials on using Weights & Biases\n",
    "\n",
